### Hexchat container for Macos

## *This is a work in progress, there might be network issues*

If, like me, you cannot understand how to install Hexchat through Macports and you would rather not open up a whole VM just to run an IRC client, this is for you. (Or could be, it's not an exact science). Anyway : 
```
git clone https://github.com/cesarfue/hexchat_macos_build
```
```
cd hexchat_macos_build && ./run.sh
```

Now, go in the xQuartz settings->security tab, and verify that connections are authentified and networks clients authorized.
