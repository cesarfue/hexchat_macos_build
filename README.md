### Hexchat container for Macos

If, like me, you cannot understand how to install Hexchat through Macports and you would rather not open up a whole VM just to run an IRC client, this is for you. (Or could be, it's not an exact science). Anyway : 
- git clone https://github.com/cesarfue/hexchat_macos_build
- cd hexchat_macos_build && ./build.sh

Now, just check in the xQuartz settings->security, the connections should be authentified and networks clients should be authorized
